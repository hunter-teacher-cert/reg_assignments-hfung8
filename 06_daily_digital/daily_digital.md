Description <br>
* The US has warned companies about the threat of a Russian cyberattack since Ukraine was invaded about a month ago. Russia is considered a cyberattack powerhouse and although no attacks have been conducted the US's national security advisor for cyber and emerging technologies warns US companies about a potential attack. So far, US companies have not heeded the warning and the US government repeatedly warns about how damaging a cyberattack could be. Russia could potentially conduct a cyberattack on the US for supplying arms and weapons to the Ukraine. In 2017, Russia launched a cyberattack on Ukraine which caused $10 Billion dollars in damages worldwide. The Biden administration's warning should be heeded, unless US companies do something about their security, they could suffer major damages if a cyberattack were conducted against the US.

I selected this story as it relates to politics that are going on in the world at the moment and the way that technology could be used to damage but also protect countries. Technology is a powerful tool that can hurt another country's infrastructure and economy.
