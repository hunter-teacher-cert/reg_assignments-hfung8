## Describe 3 different strategies for implementing differentiation in a CS class. 

**Fist to Five**

Fist to Five allows the students to explain how well they understand a certain topic. This is showcased by holding a number 
from either 0 to 5, indicated by the number of fingers shown. Fist to Five works best after a teacher has explained a difficult 
or challenging subject, and this allows the teacher to gauge how much the students have learned. It also provides a break to allow 
students to interact with the teacher, which is helpful after discussing a difficult subject. 

**Cold calling**

Cold calling can be used to gauge which students have been listening on a subject. It can be deemed a bit cruel to cold call 
on student seeing that students who might be a bit weaker might not enjoy the feeling so much. It also might come as a shock to students 
because the pace of the class suddenly vamps up and they are asked a question all of a sudden on the spot. Despite all of these setbacks,
cold calling can still be useful because it keeps the students on their toes and allows the teacher to differentiate between the students different
capbabilities.

**Socratic Method**

The Socratic Method is used to generate conversation between teacher and students, with the teacher asking questions that will lead to the student's
further understanding of the topic. It can be a useful technique to partner students in order for them to learn from each other. The role of the teacher 
is to answer the students' questions but not to give away the answer, which therein means that further discussion is involved. Students can learn from each 
other as well and the discussion that is generated will allow the teacher to differentiate the level of understanding that each student has.
