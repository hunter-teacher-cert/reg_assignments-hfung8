1. https://blog.hubspot.com/website/api-calls

The result was a blog on a website. The website goes into detail about the techniques used to create an API call but does not include any code. The example used was for making an API call using a web service called ReqBin. While this is useful for testing, it does not include the necessary coding that is required for making an API call from scratch. If they included that part into the website, it would've been more useful for other users.

The second result was a tutorial from freecodecamp. This is a trusted resource for finding information on Javascript syntax and tools for Javascript. The second result is much more in depth and provdies an example with Node JS. A web server can then host the front end part that asks the user to submit two numbers, which are added together and shown on the screen. This example goes through creating a server with express, using a fetch API Call, and dislaying information on the DOM. It contains copy and pastable code, which would be useful for people who are just starting to make API calls using fetch.

The third result was a blog from Technology Advice. This website describes what an API call is to those who have no background in tech and makes it understandable to them. There is no code on the website, but the description of an API call and the detail which the author goes into is quite good.
